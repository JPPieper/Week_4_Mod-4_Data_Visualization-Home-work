    "The top 5 schools are all charter schools while the bottom 5 all district schools.\r\n",
    "In general (one exception), per student spending is higher in bottom performing schools than top performing.\r\n",
    "Schools under 2000 students have much higher passing rates than those with student populations above 2000. A comparision of 95 to 75%. The same phenomenon is seen with high and low per student spending brackets and district versus charter school___________s.\n",
